# Physics on Hand Tracked Mesh for Oculus Hands

**Welcome to the "Physics on Hand Tracked Mesh for Oculus Hands" project!** This immersive VR experience introduces physics-based hands using the Oculus Interaction SDK, providing a highly interactive and realistic environment. With this project, the Oculus hands have been converted into mesh-based physics hands, allowing for collision interactions with the virtual environment.

## Project Overview

### Features:

- **Oculus Hands to Physics Mesh:** Experience the Oculus hands in VR, now converted into physics-based mesh hands for enhanced realism.
- **Collision Interactions:** Enjoy a more immersive VR experience as the physics hands collide with objects and surfaces that have colliders.
- **Oculus Interaction SDK:** Developed using the Oculus Interaction SDK to ensure a seamless and intuitive VR experience.
- **Realistic VR Environment:** Immerse yourself in a realistic virtual environment with physics-based hand interactions.

### Why This Project?

This project offers an exciting opportunity to explore the possibilities of physics-based interactions in VR. By converting Oculus hands into mesh-based physics hands, users can experience a more tactile and interactive virtual world where their hands interact realistically with the environment. It's a great addition to any VR experience and showcases the potential of VR physics simulations.
